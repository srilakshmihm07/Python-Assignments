# Python Practice Tasks

This folder in the repository contains two Python scripts that demonstrate the use of control structures in Python, including conditional statements and loops.

## 📘 Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

### Description
This program takes an integer input from the user and checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else condition. The result is then displayed on the screen.

### Concepts Used
- User input
- Conditional statements (if-else)
- Modulus operator

**File:** `Task_1_even_odd.py`

---

## 📘 Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

### Description
This program uses a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 50, calculates the sum of all integers in this range, and displays the final result.

### Concepts Used
- For loop
- Iteration
- Arithmetic operations

**File:** `Task_2_sum_integer.py`
