# Python Practice Tasks

This folder in the repository contains two Python scripts that demonstrate the use of functions and built-in modules in Python.

## 📘 Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

### Description
This program defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop. The function returns the calculated factorial value, which is then printed by calling the function with a sample input.

### Concepts Used
- Function definition
- Function calling
- Looping
- Return statements

**File:** `Task_1_factorial_func.py`




## 📘 Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

### Description
This program takes a number as input from the user and uses the built-in `math` module to perform mathematical calculations. The program calculates and displays the square root, natural logarithm, and sine of the given number.

### Concepts Used
- User input
- Importing modules
- Math module functions
- Mathematical computations

**File:** `Task_2_math_mod_calc.py`
