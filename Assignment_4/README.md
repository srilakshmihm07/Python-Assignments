# Python Practice Tasks

This folder in the repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate file handling operations and exception handling in Python.

## 📘 Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

### Description
This program attempts to open and read a text file named `sample.txt`. If the file exists, its contents are displayed line by line. If the file does not exist, the program handles the error gracefully and displays an appropriate message.

### Concepts Used
- File handling
- Exception handling
- Try-except block

**File:** `Task_1_read_file.py`


## 📘 Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File

### Description
This program takes user input and writes it to a file named `output.txt`. It then appends additional data to the same file and finally reads and displays the complete content of the file.

### Concepts Used
- Writing to files
- Appending data to files
- Reading file content
- User input

**File:** `Task_2_write_append_file.py`
